## VERY PREMATURE PROJECT!!! ⚠️

ChickPy is a *wannabe* grammar parser with the goal of using a custom scripting language to generate charts with several output options and backends. 
For example without knowing matplotlib or bokeh you can render charts just writing `CREATE CHART "my_chart" VALUES [1,2,3] [4,5,6] TYPE SCATTER;`.
